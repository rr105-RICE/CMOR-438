## K-Nearest Neighbors (Supervised Learning)

### Purpose

Demonstrates **KNN classification** on a small labeled dataset and shows how predictions change with different \(k\) values / distance settings.

### Files

- **Notebook**: `KNN_example.ipynb`
- **Dataset**: `iris.csv`

### How to run

Open `KNN_example.ipynb` and run all cells. The notebook expects `iris.csv` to be in the same folder.
